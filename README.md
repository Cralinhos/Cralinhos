Hey there!

I'm Carlos, a software developer based in Brazil.

I design and build modern web applications with a focus on clean UI, smooth animations, and solid architecture.
If I have an idea, I like to prototype it fast and turn it into something real.

My main tech stack is React, JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, and GSAP.
I love working with animations, interactive layouts, and creative front-end experiences.

I build projects ranging from landing pages and portfolios to full web systems with APIs and automation.

## What I'm working on
- Modern React applications
- Responsive UI systems
- Automation and API integrations

## Tech Stack
- React
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- HTML & CSS
- Node.js
- Git & GitHub
- Figma
